# Generative Perturbation Analysis for Probabilistic Black-Box Anomaly Attribution

This repository maintains the Python source code for GPA (generative perturbation analysis), first proposed in
> Tsuyoshi Ide and Naoki Abe, "**Generative Perturbation Analysis for Probabilistic Black-Box
Anomaly Attribution**" (KDD 23). 

We will include our reference implementation of GPA and its notebook as well as baseline algorithms including:
- LIME
- Shapley values
- Integrated gradient
- Expected integrated gradient
- Likelihood compensation

The initial release data is planned to be August 6, 2023 (the first day of KDD). Thank you for your patience!
